C++ for Python Programmers
==========================

This short ebook is intended to make it easy for anyone with at least some background
in Python to transition to programming in C++.

Portions of this book began as *Java for Python Programmers* by Brad Miller.
These sections were translated to C++ by Jan Pearce and a team of excellent Berea
College students in 2018 and early 2019. Other portions of this book began as
web pages written by Jan Pearce as support for a Berea College C++ programming class.
Still other sections were newly written by Jan Pearce for this ebook.

Special acknowledgement is due to  `Jesse Walker-Schadler <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwwschadler/>`_ who while just a student in the Berea College Data Structures course had a vision of making graphics in C++ as easy as they are in Python both in terms of both syntax and installations.  Over the course of two summers, he realized this vision with the creation in `the open source CTurtle library <https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle>`_ which provides all of the C++ interactive graphics in this textbook.
