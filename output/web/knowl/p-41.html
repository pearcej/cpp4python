<p>What we see is that at the core there are a few similarities with the complicated Python version, such as the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> function and the string “Hello world”. However, in C++ there is a lot more stuff around the edges that make it harder to see the core of the program. Do not worry! An important skill for a computer scientist is to learn what to ignore and what to look at carefully. You will soon find that there are some elements of C++ that will fade into the background as you become used to seeing them. One thing that will help you is to learn a little bit more about C++.</p>
