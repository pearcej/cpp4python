<ul class="disc">
<li><p>C++ is an enormous language which is very powerful because it is a high-level language that offers low-level features, but one only needs to learn a small part of the language to write effective code.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ influenced many programming languages such as C#, Java, and other newer versions of C, so by learning C++, learning these other languages becomes much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ is an industrial strength programming language and is very often used today for large systems by large groups of people.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ is particularly good at interacting directly with computer hardware, making execution very fast.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ was the first widely used object-oriented programming (OOP) language, supporting the four primary features of OOP: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ allows the programmer to create and use a data type called a pointer explicitly, which can increase control over both memory and performance under certain circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Because C++ is fast, it is currently the language of choice for virtual reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, because C++ is fast, it is the language of choice of many 2D and 3D game engines.</p></li>
<li><p>For all of the above reasons, even though C++ is an older language, it is still one of the top listed in job advertisements.</p></li>
