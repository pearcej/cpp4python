<p>Art takes a variety of forms, ranging from abstract to realistic, and consisting of an impossibly wide variety of materials. Ancient Sumerians would dye and dry small pieces of clay to create mosaics. These mosaics were often composed of shapes and patterns that would overlap without any gaps in between them. This art form is known today as tessellation, which can be observed in any modern building that is composed of bricks, or any floor covered in ceramic tiles. Mosaics are defined by their interlocking shapes, however, what these shapes are made of‒ or, the medium‒ varies depending on the artist.</p>
