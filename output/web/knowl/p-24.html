<p>These other more formal languages have some advantages of their own. First, is speed: For very large programs C and C++ are likely to give you the best performance. Second, is their maintainability. Python requires you to remember certain things. For example if you set variable <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">t</code> to reference a turtle, and forget later that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">t</code> is a turtle but try to invoke a string method on it, you will get an error. C++ protects you from this kind of error by forcing you to be upfront and formal about the type of object each variable is going to refer to.</p>
