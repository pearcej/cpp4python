<p>In modern versions of C++, you can use the &lt;string&gt; library for filenames, but earlier versions of C++ required the use of C-strings. The program above will try to open the file called “rawdata.txt” and output its results to a file called “neat.dat” every time it runs, which is not very flexible. Ideally, the user should be able to enter filenames that the program will use instead of the same names. We have previously talked about the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char</code> data type that allows users to store and manipulate a single character at a time. A sequence of characters such as “myFileName.dat” can be stored in an array of chars called a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">c-string</code>, which can be declared as follows:</p>
