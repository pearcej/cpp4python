<p>File operations, such as opening and closing files, are often a source of runtime errors for various reasons. Well-written programs always should include error checking and Handling routines for possible problems dealing with files. Error checking and handling generally involves the programmer inserting statements in functions that perform I/O to check if any of the operations have failed. In C (the predecessor to C++), the system call to open a file returns a value after the function is called. A negative number means the operation failed for some reason, which the program can check to see if reading from a file is alright. In C++, a simple error checking mechanism is provided by the member function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fail()</code>:</p>
