<li><p>Turtles, originally from the Logo programming language, is used as an educational tool. It relates to a conceptual “turtle” that runs around on a canvas and draws things.</p></li>
<li><p>Python's turtle is a great way to start coding, and until recently, C++ did not have the capability of such a library due to the complexity and required understanding of its syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Turtles have a variety of commands that are self-describing such as “forward” or “back”. Almost everything that was available to use in Python for Turtles is also available in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>The two versions of the Turtle library differ mainly in syntax, such as differences in entering color codes, and the limited variety of preset shapes available in C++. However, C++ has a few extra utilities not available in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Turtles provide methods to alter their inner workings, including some control over how many frames of animation are shown with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">tracer</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p>Every shape created and used by Turtles are a set of coordinates. We can change the shape of our turtles by using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">shape</code> method to one of four default shapes, or by manually entering coordinates and creating your own.</p></li>
