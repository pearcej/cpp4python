<p>Given that all primitive shapes are defined as a collection of points, all of the default shapes are also defined this way. Polygons, for custom and default shapes, must have their points defined in counter-clockwise order to appear correctly. This is due to the mathematics behind filling arbitrary shapes, and is a limitation almost all computer graphics need to abide by. Consider the order of their points in the following table, and how they could be considered “counter-clockwise”. They are in order from top to bottom, and one edge exists between the first last points for each of these shapes. Please note that positive Y coordinates are <em class="emphasis">lower</em> on the screen, while negative Y coordinates are <em class="emphasis">higher</em> on the screen. Coordinates at the origin– that is, coordinate 0x, 0y– is at the “point” or “tip” of the turtle. This is why most of the default shapes have their first coordinate there.</p>
