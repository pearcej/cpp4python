<p>The good news is that learning a second programming language is much easier than learning your first programming language because you will be able to draw upon your existing knowledge. Programming languages are likely to regularly change as time passes. As the field of computer science advances there are likely to be new programming languages that you will want or need to learn. There are certain features that most programming languages have in common such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. And there are other language features that are unique. If you know what is common in most languages, then in learning a new language, you need only to focus on what is different from the languages you already know.</p>
