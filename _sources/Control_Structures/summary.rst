Summary
=======
1. Like Python C++ also supports the ``if-else`` conditional statements, and they behave the same way as they do in a Python program.
2. Unlike Python, C++ does not support the use of the ``elif`` statement. However, you can get the functionality of an ``elif`` statement by nesting ``if`` and ``else`` statements in C++.
3. C++ also supports a ``switch`` statement that acts something like the elif statement of Python under certain conditions.
4. C++ supports the use of Boolean expressions in ``if-else`` statements.
