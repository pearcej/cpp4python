Welcome to *C++ for Python Programmers*
=======================================

This short ebook is intended to help Python programmers or students with at least one
term of Python programming experience learn the basics of the C++ programming language.

This book is written using the build on what you know
philosophy. In order to help you learn C++ we will start with a Python
example and then implement the example in C++. We will also
examine the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between these two
languages. As such, this book does not attempt to replace the many good C++ reference books
that are available. Please feel free to use this book for
yourself, or as a resource for a course you are teaching.
