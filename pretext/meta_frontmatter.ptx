      Special acknowledgement is due to <url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesswwalker/" visual="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesswwalker/">Jesse Walker-Schadler</url> who while just a student in the Berea College Data Structures course had a vision of making graphics in C++ as easy as they are in Python both in terms of both syntax and installations. Over the course of two summers, he realized this vision with the creation in <url href="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle" visual="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle">the open source CTurtle library</url> which provides all of the C++ interactive graphics in this textbook.

      This short ebook is intended to make it easy for anyone with at least some background in Python to transition to programming in C++.

      Portions of this book began as Java for Python Programmers by Brad Miller. These sections were translated to C++ by Jan Pearce and a team of excellent Berea College students in 2018 and early 2019. Other portions of this book began as web pages written by Jan Pearce as support for a Berea College C++ programming class. Still other sections were newly written by Jan Pearce for this ebook.
