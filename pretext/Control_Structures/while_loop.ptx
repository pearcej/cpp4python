        <title>While Loops</title>
        <p>As we noted earlier, algorithms require two important control
            structures: iteration and selection. Both of these are supported by
            Python in various forms. The programmer can choose the statement that is
            most useful for the given circumstance.</p>
        <p>For repeating a block of code, C++ provides a standard <c>while</c> and <c>for</c> constructs.
            The <c>while</c> construct repeats a body of code as long as a condition is true. For example,</p>
        <pre>int counter = 1;
while (counter &lt;= 5) {          /*Use of an interactive method until the
                                 the loop ends   */
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world" &lt;&lt; endl;
    counter = counter + 1;
}

Console output:
Hello, world
Hello, world
Hello, world
Hello, world
Hello, world</pre>
        <p>prints out the phrase <q>Hello, world</q> five times. The condition on the
            <c>while</c> statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the
            condition is <c>true</c>, the body of the statement will execute.</p>
        <p>The <c>while</c> statement is a very general purpose iterative structure
            that we will use in a number of different algorithms. In many cases, a
            compound condition will control the iteration. A fragment such as</p>
        <pre>while ((counter &lt;= 10) &amp;&amp; (!done)) {
...</pre>
        <p>would cause the body of the statement to be executed only in the case
            where both parts of the condition are satisfied due to the and operator (<c>&amp;&amp;</c>). The value of the
            variable <c>counter</c> would need to be less than or equal to 10 and the
            value of the variable <c>done</c> would need to be <c>false</c> (<c>not false</c>
            is <c>true</c>) so that <c>true and true</c> results in <c>true</c>.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the logical operators that are useful for true-false boolean statements in C++.</p>
        <pre>and          - &amp;&amp;

or           - ||

not equal to - !=

not          - !

greater than - &gt;

less than    - &lt;

greater than
or equal to  - &gt;=

less than
or equal to  - &lt;=</pre>
        <p>These are the same as we saw in earlier chapters.</p>
        <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int counter = 0;
    while (counter &lt;= 1) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
};</pre>
