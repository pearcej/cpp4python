  <title>Using Data in C++</title>
  <p>C++ requires the users specify the specific data type of each variable
            before it is used.
            The primary C++ built-in atomic data types are: integer (<c>int</c>),
            floating point (<c>float</c>), double precision floating point (<c>double</c>),
            Boolean (<c>bool</c>), and character (<c>char</c>). There is also a special
            type which holds a memory location called <c>pointer</c>. C++ also has
            collection or compound data types, which will be discussed in a future
            chapter.</p>
