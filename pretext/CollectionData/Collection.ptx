  <title>Collections</title>
  <p>In addition to the numeric, Boolean, and character types,
            C++ also offers built-in collection types.
            A <term>collection</term> data type is a grouping of some number of other data items
            (possibly only zero or one) that have some shared significance
            or need to be operated upon together.</p>
  <p>Arrays, vectors, strings, sets, and hash tables are among these useful
            C++ collection types.</p>
