        <title>Passing Streams as Parameters</title>
        <p>In the above program, you see that the input and output streams are passed to the file
            via <c>pass by reference</c>. This fact may at first seem like a surprising choice
            until you realize that a stream must be changed in order to read from it or write to it.
            In other words, as streams <q>flow</q>, they are changed.
            For this reason, all streams will always be passed by reference.</p>
