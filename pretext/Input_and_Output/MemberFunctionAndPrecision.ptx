        <title>Member Functions and Precision</title>
        <p>A function that is associated with a certain type of object is called a <term>member function</term> of that object. You have already used member functions <c>setf(...)</c> and <c>precision(...)</c> for formatting our output streams using <c>cout</c>. These functions are included briefly below:</p>
        <pre>// Use cout's member function "set flags", called setf
// The argument here means to use a fixed point rather than scientific notation
cout.setf(ios::fixed);

// Use cout's setf function again, but this time
// The argument tells cout to show the decimal point
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);

// Use cout's member function, called Precision
// The argument indicated to display 2 digits of precision
cout.precision(2);</pre>
