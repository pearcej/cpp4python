        <title>The End-Of-File (EOF) for Systems that Implement eof()</title>
        <p>So far, the assumption was that the programmer knew exactly how much data to read from
            an open file. However, it is common for a program to keep reading from a file without
            any idea how much data exists. Most versions of C++ incorporate an end-of-file (EOF)
            flag at the end of the file to let programs know when to stop.
            Otherwise, they could read data from a different file that happened to be
            right after it in the hard drive, which can be disastrous.</p>
        <p>Many development environments have I/O libraries that define how the member
            function eof() works for ifstream variables to test if this flag is set to <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>. Typically, one would like to know when the EOF has not been reached, so a common way is a negative boolean value. An alternative implementation is to keep reading using the &gt;&gt; operator; if that operation was successful (i.e. there was something in the file that was read), this success is interpreted as a 1 (true).</p>
        <p>Incidentally, that is why if you forget the second equals sign in a comparison
            between a variable and a value, you are assigning the value to the variable,
            which is a successful operation, which means the condition ends up evaluating to <c>true</c>.</p>
        <p>The following two code fragments highlight the possibilities:</p>
        <p>Using the <c>eof()</c> member function</p>
        <pre>while(!in_stream.eof()) {
    // statements to execute
    // while EOF has not been
    // reached
}</pre>
        <p>Using the &gt;&gt; operator</p>
        <pre>while(in_stream&gt;&gt;inputn) {
    // statements to execute
    // while reads are successful
}</pre>
        <p>Here is an example of a program that essentially uses the second technique
            mentioned above to read all the numbers in a file and output them in a neater format.
            The <c>while</c> loop to scan through a file is located in the <c>make_neat(...)</c> function.</p>
        <pre>// Illustrates output formatting instructions.
// Read all the numbers in the file rawdata.dat and write the numbers
// to the screen and to the file neat.dat in a neatly formatted way.

#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;  // for the exit function
#include &lt;fstream&gt;  // for I/O member functions
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;  // for the setw function
#include &lt;iostream&gt; // for cout
using namespace std;
void make_neat(
    ifstream &amp;messy_file,
    ofstream &amp;neat_file,
    int number_after_decimalpoint,
    int field_width);

int main() {
    ifstream fin;
    ofstream fout;

    fin.open("rawdata.txt");
    if (fin.fail()) { // oops the file did not exist for reading?
        cout &lt;&lt; "Input file opening failed." &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    fout.open("neat.txt");
    if (fout.fail()) { // oops the output file open failed!
        cout &lt;&lt; "Output file opening failed.\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    make_neat(fin, fout, 5, 12);

    fin.close();
    fout.close();
    cout &lt;&lt; "End of program." &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
// Uses iostreams, streams to the screen, and iomanip:
void make_neat(
    ifstream &amp;messy_file,
    ofstream &amp;neat_file,
    int number_after_decimalpoint,
    int field_width) {
    // set the format for the neater output file.
    neat_file.setf(ios::fixed);
    neat_file.setf(ios::showpoint);
    neat_file.setf(ios::showpos);
    neat_file.precision(number_after_decimalpoint);
    // set the format for the output to the screen too.
    cout.setf(ios::fixed);
    cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
    cout.setf(ios::showpos);
    cout.precision(number_after_decimalpoint);
    double next;
    while (messy_file &gt;&gt; next) { // while there is still stuff to read
        cout &lt;&lt; setw(field_width) &lt;&lt; next &lt;&lt; endl;
        neat_file &lt;&lt; setw(field_width) &lt;&lt; next &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}

        <p>The input file <c>rawdata.txt</c> must be in the same directory (folder) as the program in order for it to open successfully. The program will create a file called <q>neat.dat</q> to output the results.</p>
