            Many thanks to Runestone for creating a very strong framework for open source computing books.
            Many thanks also to Berea College's Labor Program for making it possible for students to
            undergraduate students to receive funding to contribute.

            Some sections of this book were originally written by Dr. Brad Miller as
            <alert>Java for Python Programmers</alert>. These were translated to the C++ language
            by Dr. Jan Pearce and a team of excellent students from Berea College.
            Other sections were originally written as course web pages by Dr. Jan Pearce.

            We would like to extend a special note of gratitude to
            <url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-walker-schadler-a4898916b">Jesse Walker-Schadler</url> 
            who had the vision to create the <url href="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle">CTurtle library</url>
            which makes graphing in C++ particularly easy for Python programmers because it used the
            Python Turtle library syntax, and for his excellent work in porting it to Runestone.
