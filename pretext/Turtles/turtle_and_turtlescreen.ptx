        <title>Turtle &amp; TurtleScreen</title>
        <p>Turtles must exist on a <c classes="code">TurtleScreen</c> to be used. This is a significant difference from
            Python, as you are required to create your own screen <em>before</em> creating a <c classes="code">Turtle</c> object.</p>
        <program language="cpp"><input>
ct::TurtleScreen screen;
ct::Turtle turtle(screen);
//Notice how the Screen is given to our Turtle when we create it.
</input></program>
        <p>Closing a <c classes="code">TurtleScreen</c> works exactly how it does in Python. For this chapter, only <c classes="code">bye</c> is used.
            Calling it is not completely necessary, as it is also called automatically if it, or an equivalent method, hasn't been called.
            When working outside of the textbook, the <c classes="code">exitonclick</c> method is also available.</p>
        <program language="cpp"><input>
screen.bye();
</input></program>
        <p>Turtles are based on the following premise: <q>There is a turtle on a canvas with a colored pen
            attached to their tail.</q> In this case, the <em>canvas</em> is a <c classes="code">TurtleScreen</c>. This Turtle will
            follow any command you give it, which consist of telling it to go certain directions, what color
            of pen to use, when to raise or lower its pen, and others. Below is an outline of commonly used
            methods when working with turtles.</p>

        <p>Many of these methods are used alongside one-another to create different images. All of the <c classes="code">speed</c> settings
            you may be familiar with from Python are also available in CTurtle. All speeds are measured on a range of 1 to 10,
            the latter being the fastest and the former being the slowest. The exception is the fastest speed, <c classes="code">TS_FASTEST</c>,
            which is set to 0 just as it is for Python's equivalent <c classes="code">"fastest"</c>. The <c classes="code">TS</c> prefix represents <q>Turtle Speed</q>.</p>

    ct::TurtleScreen screen;
    ct::Turtle turtle(screen);

    //Set the turtle speed to the slowest available option.
    turtle.speed(ct::TS_SLOWEST);
    //Any number from 0 to 10 would work as well.
    //turtle.speed(7);

    //Sets the turtle's fill color to purple.
    turtle.fillcolor({"purple"});

    //Tells the turtle to begin filling a shape as it moves.
    turtle.begin_fill();

    //Tells the turtle to make a square.
    //Iterates once for every corner of the square.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {

        //Tells the turtle to move forward 50 units.
        turtle.forward(50);

        //Tells the turtle to turn 90 degrees to the right.
        turtle.right(90);

    //Tells the turtle to finish filling the shape it has outlined.
    turtle.end_fill();

    //Closes the turtle screen.
    screen.bye();

        </input>
    </program>
        <p>The expected output would be a purple square in the center of the turtle's canvas.
            If you have experience with Turtles in Python, a lot of what you see in the example should look
            familiar. If not, don't worry! It will all be covered in this chapter.</p>
        <p>The order of operations given to a turtle is important, as some actions must be completed
            one after another. A good example of this is the <c classes="code">begin_fill</c> and <c classes="code">end_fill</c>
            pattern, which must be called in that specified order to actually fill a shape.</p>
