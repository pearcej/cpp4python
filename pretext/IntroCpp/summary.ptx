  <p>Now that we have run our &#x201C;hello world&#x201D; program, lets go back and look at
            it carefully to see what we can learn about the C++ language.</p>
  <program xml:id="hellocommented" interactive="activecode" language="cpp">
    <input>
/* This hello world program demonstrates the C++ concepts
    of commenting, using libraries, and using output.
*/

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){         // main() must exist &amp; return an int
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;       // 0 indicates program ended correctly.
}
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>This simple example illustrates a few very important rules:</p>
  <p>
    <ol label="1">
      <li>
        <p>Everything in C++ must be declared as a specific type of object or variable, including declaring the return type for each function.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Every C++ program must have a function which begins as <c>int main()</c>, and ends with the statement <c>return 0;</c> when successfully
                    completed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>C++ statements are ended by a semi-colon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>White space is mostly meaningless in C++, but all C++ code blocks must be surrounded by curly brackets {}, rather than using
                    indentation to delineate blocks as is done in Python.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
