  <title>Welcome to <em>C++ for Python Programmers</em></title>
  <p>This short ebook is intended to help Python programmers or students with at least one
            term of Python programming experience learn the basics of the C++ programming language.</p>
  <p>This book is written using the build on what you know
            philosophy. In order to help you learn C++ we will start with a Python
            example and then implement the example in C++. We will also
            examine the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between these two
            languages. As such, this book does not attempt to replace the many good C++ reference books
            that are available. Please feel free to use this book for
            yourself, or as a resource for a course you are teaching.</p>
